In this project, we implement six models, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, (Support Vector Machine) SVM, Random Forest, and Adaboost. To train our model, we use 2 different dataset. The dataset can be found inside the "dataset" folder.

We also implement a Neural Network model which can be found inside "notebooks/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.py". The analysis is done in "notebooks/NeuralNetwork/NN_analysis.ipynb" We use popular MNIST dataset to train and test our model.

To run the models do the following steps.

1. To run all of the ML Classifiers except Neural Network, run notebooks/{classifierName}.ipynb
i.e., notebooks/SVM.ipynb, notebooks/RandomForest.ipynb
2. To run the neural Neural Network model run notebooks/NeuralNetwork/NN_analysis.ipynb
